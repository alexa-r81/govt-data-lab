#I chose this data set (bachelor majors by gender and state) because I thought I have an interest in women in STEM. I am apart of a women in STEM club at my school, so I thought it would be very interesting to see the percentage of female compared to male. I also wanted to see if there was any correlation between state, so maybe if more conservative state had a lower percent of female STEM majors. This is why I chose female percent in Texas as the list in this exercise, because Texas is very conservative. However, I'm not sure if there is any correlation yet because I haven't looked at the other states yet. However, you can kind of see how the stats change with the times, for example you can see that the percentage of women (ages 25-39) with a Science or Engineering major is much higher than the percentage of women (ages 65+) with a Science or Engineering major, which makes sense because of how much social norms have changed.
